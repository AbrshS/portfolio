      Hello! I&apos;m Abraham and I love building tech that solves real problems. My journey began when I first discovered how a few lines of code could create something useful - and I&apos;ve been hooked ever since.

From startups to large-scale projects, I&apos;ve had the chance to work across different industries, turning complex challenges into elegant digital solutions. These days, I focus on crafting intelligent, user-friendly systems that are as functional as they are innovative - because great technology should work seamlessly and adapt effortlessly.
